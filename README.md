Histogram Analysis and Contrast stretching
1. Plot input image histogram.
   * that display the distribution of pixel intensities.
2. Histogram shift by value.
   * Shifts the histogram by a specified value, effectively changing the brightness or contrast of the image. This operation is useful for adjusting the overall brightness level.
3. Plot the cumulative image histogram
   * Computes and plots the cumulative histogram of the input image, providing insights into the cumulative distribution of pixel intensities.
4. Perform histogram equalization, This technique redistributes pixel intensities to achieve a more balanced histogram.
   * Plot equalized image
   * Plot equalized image histogram.
   * Plot equalized image cumulative histogram.
5. contrast stretching
   1. Using image histogram to deduce parameters for contrast stretching
         * Analyzes the image histogram to determine suitable parameters for contrast stretching, such as minimum and maximum intensity values.
   2. Apply contrast stretching on the corresponding image
         * Utilizes the deduced parameters to perform contrast stretching, expanding the dynamic range of pixel intensities to enhance image contrast and improve visual clarity.
