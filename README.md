Histogram Analysis and Contrast stretching
1. Plot the corresponding image histogram
2. Histogram shift by value
3. Plot the cumulative image histogram
4. Perform histogram equalization
   * Plot equalized image
   * Plot equalized image histogram.
   * Plot equalized image cumulative histogram.
5. contrast stretching
   * Using image histogram to deduce parameters for contrast stretching
   * Apply contrast stretching on the corresponding image
